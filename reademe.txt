If you want to change anything for whatever reason, I can send you a developer invite, or you can just email it
to me or something.

Instructions on how to run:

I don't actually really know how to compile things on my own yet. I've just been
compiling them in IntelliJ, so I guess any way you can compile it would be good

Some lines that I was talking about in the email:

432: Player
414: Player
392: Player
367: Player
319: Player

These are just a few examples and I feel like there is a much more compact way to do the same
thing that isn't a switch statement. Maybe not though.

I have run into a bug when dropping an item after equipping it, but it only happened once and
could not replicate it, so if you run into that bug and have any ideas on why it happened,
please let me know.

As for the actual playability of the game, I have not played through it all myself because I don't
have nearly enough time. You can use debug commands to jump around and stuff though if you would
like to do that.

debug commands:

coordinate [xy] - returns the players current x and y positions
[d]amage - prompts you to input a number then deals that amount of damage to the player
[h]eal - prompts you to input a number then heals the player for that amount
[e]xpup - prompts you to input a number then grants the player that much exp
[l]evelup - prompts you to input a number then grants the player that many levels
[a]ddtobag - prompts you to input an item name then adds that item to your bag
attack - prompts you to input a number then sets the player's attack equal to that number
health - prompts you to input a number then sets the player's health equal to that number
die - kills the player
head - prints any item on the player's head
hand - prints any item in the player's hand
[g]oto - prompts an x coordinate then a y coordinate and moves the player there
